## Goal
Transform the landing page into a professional, high-impact event website with "flare". The design should reflect the sophisticated nature of the "Mushroom World" theme while providing a smooth, modern user experience.

## Design Changes
- **Typography & Layout**: Used bold, heavy headings (`font-black`) and wide tracking to create an "event" feel.
- **Color Palette**: Enhanced the "Mushroom" colors with deeper forest greens, vibrant amber accents, and creamy backgrounds.
- **Glassmorphism**: Consistent use of backdrop-blur and semi-transparent layers for a modern aesthetic.
- **Animations**: 
    - Smooth scroll behavior.
    - Custom Tailwind animations: `fade-in-up`, `fade-in-down`.
    - Floating effects and soft pulses for interactive elements.
- **Navigation**: Implemented a sticky, glassmorphic navbar that changes style on scroll.

## Component Enhancements
- **Hero**: Complete redesign with a massive heading, background patterns, and a clear primary CTA.
- **Speakers**: Professional cards with hover scaling and shadow depth.
- **Agenda**: A structured timeline using a highlighted list pattern.
- **Registration**: A focused, clean form centered in a large glass card with improved feedback animations.
- **Footer**: A proper site footer with social links, navigation, and contact info.

## Visual Flare
- Added background SVG patterns (leaves/forest texture).
- Integrated Lucide-vue-next icons for all sections.
- Improved visual feedback for registration (glowing avatars, large icons).
